# Sales-Report
This project showcases an end-to-end data analytics workflow using SQL and Power BI. The dataset, sourced from Kaggleâ€™s sample sales data, was cleaned and transformed in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to ensure data consistency, handle missing values, and optimize for reporting. Created an interactive Power BI dashboard for comprehensive sales reporting, including sales performance, profit and loss (P&L), customer analysis, and employee insights. Used DAX measures and data modeling to added dynamic slicers for year and region, and optimized visuals for clear business insights.
